# CSE 141L Lab 4

## Overview

This project includes the top-level design for the [$NAME instruction set
architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/132XERID4oe9Ok5qbLtYRtNQLa4-OtiPEV4KUNNnETUY/edit?usp=sharing),
as well as the machine code for the three programs required for lab4.
## InstrROM is configured to read machine_code.txt file found in simulation/modelsim.
## The source files for each program are found in src/assembler/programs/
## To create machine code run: 
python src/assembler/assembler.py src/assembler/programs/program(1,2,3,orAll).txt simulation/modelsim/machine_code.txt
The demo for this lab4 can be found
[here]().
